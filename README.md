# Gideon v4

This was my first discord bot from which i had started Discord Bot dev in python. So yeah over an year (give or take) I developed it to the code you can see in v4. It has a lot of bad practices and inefficient methods used in the code but then again it was my first major project in Python and Discord.

This uses Disnake a Python wrapper for the Discord API

I wouldn't recommend duplicating this code cus it's really bad but I've made it public in case it can help any of the people out there who've started Bot Dev. So kudos and good luck hope this helps. If you need any help DM me on my discord or feel free to open up an issue or post in Discussions. Make sure to check out my other EDITH bot repository for better code in a more updated python and disnake version.
